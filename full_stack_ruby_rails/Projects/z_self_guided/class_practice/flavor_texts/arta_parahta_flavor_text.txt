Arta-Parahta: The Kingdom of Stone and Struggle
    A land of towering peaks, deep chasms, and sun-scorched wastelands, Arta-Parahta is a realm of unyielding endurance and unbreakable spirit. Its people are as rugged as the mountains they carve their homes into, as resilient as the desert winds that shape their destiny. The land is rich in ore, gemstones, and secrets buried beneath rock and sand, fiercely guarded by its inhabitants, who have long repelled invaders seeking to claim its wealth.

    The Ironpeak Mountains dominate the region, where miners, warriors, and rune-smiths live in fortified cliffside villages, extracting the treasures of the earth while defending their homes from outsiders. At the base of the mountains, the Bleakrock Pass is a treacherous and unforgiving land, where the desperate and exiled seek redemption or perish in the wild. To the west, the Enders Plateau, an arid and desolate land, serves as a testing ground for the unworthy, where only those with the strength to survive may earn their place among the mountainfolk.

    A single, foreboding fortress-keep, OnglÃ®n-i-Gorlak, looms over the peaks, home to the warlord-lords of Arta-Parahta, whose rule is forged in steel and stone.

    The people of Arta-Parahta are fiercely independent, deeply bound to tradition, and unyielding in their ways. Strength is the only law they recognize, and hardship is their greatest teacher.
