Thalindor Naming Conventions: Rules & Structure
    Thalindor is a realm of wealth, trade, shifting alliances, and merchant power. This means their
    names should reflect:

    Cosmopolitan & Merchant-Class Influences –
        Names should feel fluid, sophisticated, and carry traces of diverse linguistic roots,
        as Thalindor is a hub of trade and culture.

    Dynastic Merchant Houses & Family Lineage –
        Surnames should sound like established family names rather than purely occupational titles.

    Nomadic & Desert Influences –
        Eastern, Arabic, and Mediterranean-inspired phonetics make sense for desert dwellers
        and caravan folk.

    A Separation Between Noble Merchant Houses, Middle-Class Traders, and Lowborns –
        Names should indicate status within Thalindor’s mercantile hierarchy.

    Common Patterns for Thalindor Surnames:
        1. Merchant & Dynastic Surnames
            These names represent powerful trade families, banking guilds, and influential houses.
            They often have soft-yet-regal sounds, with vowels flowing smoothly and consonants balanced.

            Formation:
            Many end in “-is,” “-an,” “-ar,” “-on,” or “-iel” to evoke a classical, noble feel.
            Prefixes may come from historical figures, patron deities, or old trade guilds.

            Examples:
                - Belvahn (From “Bel” (lord) + “Vahn” (keeper/guardian) → Old merchant house)
                - Salzhad (“Salt-lord” → a family that controlled salt trade routes)
                - Duskari (From “Duskar” (gold-lit sands) → an old aristocratic desert-born dynasty)

        2. Middle-Class Traders & Craftsmen
            These names are less grandiose than noble houses, often originating from crafts, ports, or regional names.

            Formation:
            Blended occupational roots with refined endings (e.g., "-ir," "-an," "-ash").
            Inspired by local landmarks, port towns, or professions.

            Examples:
                - Ralven (From “Ral” (bronze) + “ven” (hand) → smithing or metal-trade family)
                - Darqir (“Dar” (keeper) + “qir” (spices) → spice merchants or caravan leaders)
                - Veylan (From “Vey” (sea) + “lan” (trade) → ship-owning merchant family)

        3. Desert Nomad & Oasis-Tender Surnames
            The Oasis-Tenders and desert-born merchants carry names that sound more fluid and ancient, reflecting deep ties to the desert and its sacred resources.

            Formation:
            Often have elongated vowels and softened consonants for a mystical, oral-tradition feel.
            Many end in “-zir,” “-ad,” “-esh,” “-ayn” to reflect lyrical, Arabic-Persian influences.
            Prefixes might relate to natural features like the moon, sand, stars, and water sources.

            Examples:
                - Zahadi (From “Zahad” (desert star) → a name tied to the celestial skies)
                - Miravesh (From “Mira” (oasis) + “Vesh” (keeper) → guardians of water sources)
                - Asfarin (From “Asfar” (traveler) → an ancient nomadic family lineage)

        4. Lowborn or Bastard Surnames in Thalindor
            Since Thalindor is ruled by wealth, not bloodline, bastards and lowborn families would likely take derisive, descriptive, or place-based surnames.

            Common Naming Traits:
            Often mark outcasts, debtors, or dishonored traders.
            Names might be based on where they were born (ports, desert fringes, or slums).
            Others are nicknames that stuck due to debt, bad business, or family disgrace.

            Examples:
            - Jalresh (“Jal” (sand) + “resh” (worn/tattered) → meaning a “wandering drifter” or “beggar”)
            - Korrinash (From “Kor” (debt) + “rinash” (lost one) → a name for someone born into a ruined merchant house or a family marked by failure in trade)
            - Saevren (From “Saev” (coin) + “ren” (fallen) → a bastard-born trader, someone cast out of a once-wealthy house)


Thalindor: The Merchant’s Dominion
    A land of bustling ports, sprawling deserts, and boundless opportunity, Thalindor is a realm where commerce reigns supreme. Unlike other kingdoms ruled by kings or warlords,
    Thalindor is governed by the Merchant’s Guild, a powerful syndicate that values wealth over bloodlines and trade over conquest. Here, coin speaks louder than titles, and alliances
    shift like the desert sands as merchants, mercenaries, and pirates vie for fortune and influence.

    The Herdirnen Bay is the heart of Thalindor’s maritime trade, with grand harbors, towering ships, and sprawling markets where goods from across the world exchange hands.
    Further north, the plains of Calenmor stretch endlessly, home to caravan guides and mercenary escorts who protect the lifeblood of trade. To the east, the Anír Gilith Desert is a vast
    and unforgiving wasteland, where only the oases provide shelter for weary travelers. The Oasis-Tenders, desert nomads and traders, maintain these vital water sources, ensuring the desert
    roads remain open for those willing to pay.

    There is no singular ruler in Thalindor, only the ever-shifting balance of power among the Guilds, where gold is law, and profit is king.
