NAMING RULES:
The Nors are a people shaped by harsh winters, towering forests, and the struggle to endure. Their names should sound strong, practical, and deeply
tied to ancestry—with an emphasis on patronymic and familial lineage.

Key Traits of Noric Names:
    - Patronymic-Based Surnames – Many last names derive from a notable ancestor or legendary figure, often using "-sen/-son" (son of) or "-dotr" (daughter of) endings.
    - Nature & Craft-Based Names – Some families adopt surnames based on their trade, home region, or the natural world, often influenced by Old Norse, Anglo-Saxon, and Finnish phonetics.
    - Clan & Lineage Identity – Surnames are not just identifiers but carry the weight of history, often linked to warriors, chieftains, or legendary deeds.
    - Lowborn or Bastard Names Reflect Exile or Disgrace – Unlike Thalindor, where money rules, in Norórë, honor and survival define one's place. Bastards or outcasts bear harsh, unembellished surnames.

    Patronymic Adaptations (Subtle, rather than direct "-son" names)
        While Norse tradition often used "-sson" (meaning "son of"), these surnames adapt it into more natural, noble-sounding forms for a Tolkien-esque feel.

            EXAMPLE: Noric Surnames (Patronymic Adaptation Style)
            Male:
                - Vaedric Ironholt (from "Iron stronghold" → ancestry of smiths and warriors)
                - Hjalmar Vaelstrund (from "Vael’s stronghold" → descendants of a legendary leader)
                - Othric Skarnvald (from "Skarn" (raw ore) + "Vald" (domain) → lineage of miners and stoneworkers)

            Female:
                - Sigrun Halvarsen (from "Halvar’s line" → descendants of an old chieftain)
                - Astrid Dornveig (from "Dorn" (thorn) + "Veig" (strength) → a family known for resilience)
                - Yrla Stenvarn (from "Sten" (stone) + "Varn" (protector) → a clan of fortress builders)

            common / bastard last names:
            Gullveig (“Gold’s Curse” / “The Cursed One”):
                Rooted in gull (gold) and veig (strength or curse).
                Used for those descended from disgraced or fallen families, often linked to betrayal, dishonor, or greed.
                Can apply to bastards, but also to those whose ancestors were stripped of their lands and titles.

            Varnrik (“Forsaken Stronghold” / “Outcast’s Refuge”)
                From varn (protector/defender) + rik (abandoned place/stronghold).
                Given to those who descend from broken lineages—perhaps a fallen warrior, a ruined bloodline, or an outcast’s child.
                Can imply one whose family once held power but lost it, or a bastard never recognized by their kin.

            Hailstrund (“Storm-Born” / “Child of No Name”)
                From hail (storm) + strund (drifting, shoreline).
                Often given to those who were born in dire circumstances—a bastard left to the mercy of the elements, a child abandoned to fate, or one raised among outsiders.
                It can also signify a roving, nameless existence, fitting for someone who has no claim to family or land.


Norórë: The Land of Ice and Timber
    Norórë is a land of dense, whispering forests, towering frost-capped mountains, and an unforgiving climate. Its people, known as the Nors, are a hardy and resilient folk, shaped by the land’s extremes.
    They dwell in three distinct regions: the mountain folk at the foot of the Frozenpeak Range, the forest dwellers who call the Whispering Woods home, and the protectors of the Frostvale Basin,
    where the chieftains convene to uphold ancient traditions.

    Life in Norórë is built upon self-sufficiency, community, and a deep reverence for the land. Their villages are hidden among the towering trees or nestled against sheer cliffs, blending seamlessly
    into the wild. Their settlements are built from dark timber and stone, with thatched roofs reinforced to withstand the heavy snowfall of the long, harsh winters. Hunting, woodcraft,
    and smithing are integral to survival, and each clan passes down skills honed over centuries.

    The Noric people value strength, wisdom, and honor—whether in battle, craftsmanship, or governance. Decisions are made collectively by the Council of Chieftains, who gather in the Frostvale Basin
    under the ancient oaths of their ancestors. Norórë is a land where survival is a test of will, and only the strongest endure.

    HONOR - The Strength of Tradition:
        Norórë holds honor as an unshakable foundation, bound by duty, ancestral legacy, and unbreakable oaths. To act dishonorably is to disgrace your lineage. Betrayal is the gravest sin,
        and to die with one’s word unbroken is the truest measure of worth. Nature is the "first mother", and should be respected and studied. Nors pull all traditions from the land, including
        their war tactics, mannerisms, culture, and magics. The north most mountains which the Nors call home are ancient, and so are the gods that dwell within them. The Nors believe that the gods
        are the land, and their spirit agents reside in all things from trees to rocks to animals.

    Warrior of Norórë: The Ironbound Shields
        Description:

            the snowy terrain and dense underbrush, moving like living shadows of the forest. Their weapons are simple but deadly—hand-forged axes, broad-bladed swords,
            and great wooden circle shields adorned with clan insignias. Warriors undergo harsh training from childhood, learning to fight in blizzards, dense woods, and steep mountain passes.

            Core Tenets of Noric Warriors:
                - Honor is steel unbroken." A warrior’s word is as strong as the iron he wields. Oaths are sacred, and betrayal is met with exile or execution.
                - The land provides all, and the land takes all." They fight not for wealth or conquest, but to protect the sanctity of their land and their people.
                - Weakness is not in the body, but in the spirit." Injury or age does not dishonor a warrior—cowardice, deceit, and betrayal do.

            - The Shield Oath – Before battle, warriors bind their shields together and recite the names of their ancestors, swearing that they will not fall while their kin still stand.
            - The Blood Braid – Warriors braid their hair and beards with iron rings—each ring represents a battle survived. To cut the braid is a mark of dishonor.
