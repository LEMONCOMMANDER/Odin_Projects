Iavren-Cuio: The Kingdom of Sunlit Plains and Unyielding Honor
A land of golden fields, rolling hills, and thriving cities, Iavren-Cuio is a prosperous and disciplined kingdom. Its fertile plains and expansive farmland sustain its bustling towns, while its strongholds and fortresses ensure security and order. The kingdom is renowned for its architecture, grand roads, and powerful cavalry, as well as the wisdom of its scholars and mages.

The heart of Iavren-Cuio is Ardhon, an imposing fortress-city that serves as the capital, where noble houses govern alongside scholars, warriors, and the royal family. To the north, the Caelond Hills create a natural barrier, dotted with castles and watchtowers that stand as sentinels against northern threats. To the south, the Eldenmir Plains stretch endlessly, home to farming communities and military encampments. To the east, the Green Sea, an untamed, windswept land, is home to nomadic riders and free-spirited wanderers who live by a different code than the more regimented citizens of the cities.

Iavren-Cuioâ€™s people value honor, discipline, and intellect, believing that prosperity comes from order, strength, and wisdom. The kingdom's army is one of the most disciplined and well-equipped, and its mage-lords ensure that arcane power serves the state rather than chaos. Roads are safe, cities thrive, and enemies dare not tread upon the well-guarded fields of Iavren-Cuio.
